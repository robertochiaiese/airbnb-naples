# Airbnb Market & Revenue Analysis – Naples
---

## Executive Summary  

Using publicly available data from **Inside Airbnb**, I analyzed the Airbnb market in Naples to understand pricing dynamics, revenue distribution, and differences across neighbourhoods, room types, and property characteristics.  

The project involved extensive data cleaning and transformation using **Excel Power Query**, data modeling with **Excel Power Pivot**, and the development of an interactive **two-page dashboard**.  

The dashboard provides both a high-level market overview and a deeper analysis of **estimated revenue and occupancy patterns**, enabling stakeholders to explore how location, host type, and property features influence performance.

## Business Problem  

Naples is a highly heterogeneous Airbnb market, with significant variation in prices, ratings, and revenue potential across neighbourhoods and property types.  

For hosts, investors, and market analysts, understanding **which areas and listing characteristics drive higher prices and revenue** is essential for making informed decisions.  

This project aims to answer the following questions:

- How do prices vary across neighbourhoods and room types?  
- Which property and host characteristics are associated with higher average prices?  
- How is estimated revenue distributed across different types of listings?

## Methodology  

### Data Cleaning & Preparation  
- Handled missing values and removed duplicates  
- Corrected data quality issues (typos, inconsistent formats, and errors)  
- Standardized categorical variables (room type, property type, host attributes)  
- Enriched and prepared the dataset using **Excel Power Query**

### Data Modeling  
- Built relationships and calculated fields using **Excel Power Pivot**  
- Created measures for pricing, estimated occupancy, and estimated revenue  

### Dashboard Development  
- Designed a **two-page interactive dashboard**:  
  - **Page 1:** Market overview and pricing analysis  
  - **Page 2:** Estimated revenue and occupancy analysis  
- Implemented slicers to explore data by host type, property type, and host verification status

## Results & Business Recommendations

### Key Results
- **Entire homes/apartments** generate the highest share of estimated annual revenue, far outperforming private and shared rooms.  
- **Superhosts** achieve higher estimated occupancy and revenue compared to basic hosts, highlighting the importance of trust and host credibility.  
- **Listings accommodating 2–4 guests** represent the most demanded segment in terms of occupancy.  
- **Property type** strongly influences revenue potential, with entire apartments, condos, and villas showing the highest average estimated revenue.  

### Business Recommendations
- **Prioritize entire-property listings**: New or prospective hosts should focus on entire homes or apartments rather than shared or private rooms.  
- **Target small to medium-sized groups**: Properties designed for 2–4 guests are more likely to achieve higher occupancy.  
- **Invest in host quality**: Achieving Superhost status and completing identity verification can significantly improve revenue performance.  
- **Use pricing and revenue benchmarks**: Analyze room and property type benchmarks to set realistic expectations and competitive pricing strategies.

## Next Steps  

Future improvements to this project could include:
- Incorporating booking-level or calendar availability data to calculate **actual revenue**  
- Extending the analysis to multiple cities for cross-market comparison  
- Enhancing the dashboard with time-based analysis (seasonality and trends)  
- Integrating predictive models to estimate revenue under different pricing scenarios
